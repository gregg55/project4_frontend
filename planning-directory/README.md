## Getting Started

Our Breweries Home Page can provide the end _USER_ with the Name, Address, City, and State for any Brewery within your Search criteria. It also includes a location map.

### Current Features

Our Current Features allow user to search by `_City_`, `_State`_, and to filter the results by `_Type_`.  These features are described below. 

### `Search by CITY`

To do a search by `CITY`, the user can select the respective city that they would like to find the local breweries. An Example may be _Ankeny_ or _San Diego_. Input text for searching can be submitted by either pressing the ENTER key or clicking the submit button.

### `Search by STATE`

To search by `STATE`, they can select the respective STATE that they would like to find the breweries. An Example may be _Iowa_ or _California_. Input text for searching can be submitted by either pressing the ENTER key or clicking the submit button.

### `Filter the result`

The app provides the capability of filtering the search result by `TYPE`. A user can select the respective brewery TYPE that they would like to find in that specific city or state. An Example may be _nano_ or _regional_ or _micro_.

`micro` - Most craft breweries are considered a micro brewery.
<br/>
`nano` - Extremely small brewery which typically only distributes locally.
<br/>
`regional` - A regional location of an an expanded brewery. Ex. Sierra Nevada's Asheville, NC Location.
<br/>
`large` - A very large brewery. Ex. Miller-Coors. 

- After a search request is submitted, the app returns a full list of brewery names. By default all the filter checkboxes are
not ticked. 
  
- If any number of the checkboxes are selected, the page will only show a subset of the results that meets the selection request. 
  
- Full results are shown if all or none of the checkboxes are selected.
  
- The results are dynamically refreshed. An example would be that if `micro` is selected after which another `TYPE` is checked,the content would update upon each request submission.

<!-- # Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
